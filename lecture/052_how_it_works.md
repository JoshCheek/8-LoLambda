How the lambda calculus works
-----------------------------

Alright, the lambda calculus has three things in it:

1. **functions** these take inputs and return an output
  (they call this a "lambda abstractions")
2. **variables** names a function can use to reference its arguments
3. **function calls** so that you can run the function! (called an "application")
