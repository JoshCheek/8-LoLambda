How the lambda calculus works
-----------------------------

Alright, the lambda calculus has four things in it:

1. **functions** take inputs and return an output
2. **variables** are names a function can use to reference
   its arguments.
3. **function calls** give the arguments values and then run
   the expression in the body.
4. **parentheses** let us group things together,
   the same way we might use them in mathematics.

It's worth memorizing these things to help you remember that
if it's not in this list, then it does not exist. The value of
that realization is that it significantly limits your search
space as you try to find solutions to the challenges ahead.

It's easy to memorize them if you think about their relationship,
for instance, one of the first three things necessitates the other two.
I'll leave it to you to think about which this is.
