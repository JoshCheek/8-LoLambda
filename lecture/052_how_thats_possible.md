How can you have only lambdas?
------------------------------

When we say something like `31 + 9`, this doesn't mean anything
until we define what `31` is, what `9` is, and what `+` is!

Why is assembly so fascinating? Because this magical expression suddenly makes
sense! We can finally see how `31` is represented in binary, we can see how it
translates to a sequence of electrical values that are stored in hardware.
And what of addition? Just a circuit that takes those electrical signals as
inputs and outputs electrical signals that correspond to `40`, their sum!

The lambda calculus is no different, we must define what `31` means and what
`9` means and then we must must create a function that can take them as inputs
and return a value that we consider to be the sum, `40`.

We've already seen this with our definition of true.
