What is "calculus"?
-------------------

My dictionary says "calculus" is

> A particular method or system of calculation or reasoning.

If you **only** had functions to work with (no numbers, no strings,
no assignments, no objects, etc), you'd have to create a system of
reasoning to get anything done.
