What is a lambda?
-----------------

A lambda is their word for a function. So if you know what a function is
in JavaScript, or what a lambda / proc / block is in Ruby,
then you already know what a lambda is!

```js
META isReadOnly: true
Î»x.x                     // Lambda Calculus
function(x) { return x } // JavaScript
lambda { |x| x }         // Ruby
```

They use the word "Lambda" because it was written by mathematicians,
and mathematicians like to use single letters. When they ran out of letters,
they went to the Greek alphabet. Lambda is basically the Greek equivalent to
our letter "L", and in the lambda calculus, it means the same thing that
"function" means in JavaScript.
