What is a lambda?
-----------------

In the lambda calculus, a lambda is a function. So if you know JavaScript
or Ruby, then you already know what a lambda is!

This expression in lambda calculus:

```js
Î»x.x                     // Lambda Calculus
function(x) { return x } // JavaScript
lambda { |x| x }         // Ruby
```

<aside>
They use the word "Lambda" because it was written by mathematicians,
and mathematicians like to use single letters. When they ran out of letters,
they went to the Greek alphabet. Lambda is basically the Greek equivalent to
our letter "L", and in the lambda calculus, it means the same thing that
"function" means in JavaScript.
