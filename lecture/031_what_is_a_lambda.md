What is a lambda?
-----------------

A lambda is their word for what JavaScript calls a function
and what Ruby calls a lambda / proc / block.
So if you feel comfortable with any of those words, then
then you already know what a lambda is!

```js
META id: whatIsALambda
META isReadOnly: true
Î»x.x                     // Lambda Calculus
function(x) { return x } // JavaScript
lambda { |x| x }         // Ruby
```

They use the word "Lambda" because it was written by Alonzo Church,
a mathematician, and mathematicians like to use single letters.
When they ran out of letters, they went to the Greek alphabet.
Lambda is basically the Greek equivalent to our letter "L",
and in the lambda calculus, it means the same thing that
"function" means in JavaScript.
