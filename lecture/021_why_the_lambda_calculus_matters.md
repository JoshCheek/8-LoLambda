Why the lambda calculus matters
-------------------------------

It's one of a handful of popular definitions of computation.
This means we can formally reason about what a computer can
do by reasoning about what the lambda calculus can do.

Another popular definition of computability is the Turing Machine,
hence phrases like "turing complete" which implies that something
can be used as a programming language.
