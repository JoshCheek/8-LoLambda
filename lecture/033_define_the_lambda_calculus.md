Definition of the lambda calculus
---------------------------------

So the lambda calculus is just a way to reason about
a programming language built entirely out of lambdas.

How do you do anything when you don't have true and false?
When you don't hav eif statements, numbers, and strings?

Well, whatever the answer is, it'll be a system for working
with lambdas, a lambda calculus :)
