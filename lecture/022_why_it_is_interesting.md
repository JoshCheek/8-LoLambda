Why the lambda calculus is interesting
--------------------------------------

Haskell made me a determinist.
All my logic was leading to something like that, but I couldn't conceive of
how it was able to explain what I perceived as free will.
Once I played with Haskell, I saw that things which appear to change
can be explained in a world that doesn't.

The lambda calculus underlies Haskell and all the other
functional programming languages. Lisps like Clojure, and Scheme
(the language of SICP) are also functional and are thus based on the ideas
in the lambda calculus.
