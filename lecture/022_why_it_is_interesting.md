Why the lambda calculus is interesting
--------------------------------------

IDK if this is real, but I like to think the lambda calculus and the turing
machine as giving rise to two different branches of programming.

The turing machine leads to procedural languages, where the programmer
specifies the instructions that the machine should perform.

The lambda calculus leads to functional languages, where the programmer uses a
declarative mathematical notation to reason about a problem.

So if you like Clojure, Haskell, ML, and Elm, well their foundation is the
lambda calculus. Even if not, it's worth playing with because ideas from the
lambda calculus have permeated most languages at this point. For instance,
we've already shown their prevalence in JavaScript and Ruby.
