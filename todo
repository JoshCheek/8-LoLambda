* Either add auto-saved blocks that don't have buttons
  or change the material on "Translating our code" to
  be an explanation without blocks that they edit
  (then they can do the work on Final Booleans)
* The names should be more obvious
* Needs more attention paid to calling curried functions
* If there is a solution, then add a button that fills the body in with the solution
  (or maybe toggles it?)
* Maybe something which forces them to deal with explicitly thinking through the function calls?

----  MAYBE TODO  -----
Keybindings for:
  Move to the next editor
Assign the functions a name so that when we inspect them,
  we can see their name instead of having to look at their structure
