* read-only code blocks should have a different bg color
* Either add auto-saved blocks that don't have buttons
  or change the material on "Translating our code" to
  be an explanation without blocks that they edit
  (then they can do the work on Final Booleans)

----  TODO  -----
Go through the material I think is correct
  making sure it is correct / I like it
Add the next couple sections
Maybe refine the material at that point

Some code will depend on previous solutions,
  some way (metadata) for them to declare what they depend on
  some way to make it available to them

Keybindings for:
  Move to the next editor

Assign the functions a name so that when we inspect them,
  we can see their name instead of having to look at their structure
