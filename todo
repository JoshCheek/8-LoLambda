----  TODO  -----
Render html instead of markdown as a string
CodeBocks background is too large (also too bright, but w/e)
Require sections to have an id and linkName

Test/write fn to receive events and update the state
  events:
    run test (id, body)
    save result (id, body)
    goto (id) // section | component
    editCode (id, body)
Begin trying to implement in react
Once it begins to take shape in react
  Start testing it
  Reference ~/code/api-mashup
  On the verbose branch
  In the experiments dir
Invite some humans (corey, michael, uhm, any others?)


-----  Other Thoughts  -----
Options:
  editor style (emacs/vim/sublime/default)
  language (js/ruby)

Keybindings for:
  run tests for each one   (what does FCC use?)
  Move to the next editor

Assign the functions a name so that when we inspect them,
  we can see their name instead of having to look at their structure

Solutions in both JS and Ruby
