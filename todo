----  TODO  -----
Display test status
Wire buttons up
  run needs to run the tests against it and update their state
    (do I need to use web workers? since it could loop forever?)
Some code will depend on previous solutions,
  some way (metadata) for them to declare what they depend on
  some way to make it available to them
Fn to update the state
Save state in local storage?
Test React?
How / where to host it?

Options:
  editor style (emacs/vim/sublime/default)
  language (js/ruby)

Keybindings for:
  run tests for each one   (what does FCC use?)
  Move to the next editor

Assign the functions a name so that when we inspect them,
  we can see their name instead of having to look at their structure
