----  TODO  -----
Some code will depend on previous solutions,
  some way (metadata) for them to declare what they depend on
  some way to make it available to them

Options:
  editor style (emacs/vim/sublime/default)
  language (js/ruby)

Keybindings for:
  run tests for each one   (what does FCC use?)
  Move to the next editor

Assign the functions a name so that when we inspect them,
  we can see their name instead of having to look at their structure
